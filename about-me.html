              <span>saved my life I used to be a pack rat.</span> I had so many
              things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't
              even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
            </p>
            <p class="column-1__para">
              Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
              didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

              I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my
              place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.

              It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
              place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

              Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
              less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
              to enjoy.
